Welcome to the Game of Othello! Your configurations are as follows: 
                1. It is usually white's turn first with the AI playing as black, but that is configurable
                2. Max depth of the tree for minimax with alpha beta pruning is usually 10, although any range from 1-50.
                
                The white are white pieces, black are blacks, and the X's are the
                moves you or the AI can make on that turn.
                (0,0) is the bottom left of the board. Please do a turn by using
                the do_turn(x, y) method where x is the x coordinate, and y is the y
                coordinate of the move you would like to make.
                The board will refresh twice every do_turn iteration, once for the human's
                turn and once for the AI. Good Luck!
